# Calories calculator app

This project is designed to determine how much calories do we need daily to achieve our healthy body.

## Design

The application has been created on React from the scratch. It's the first version.

### Components

Entire page is rendered with React Components. Components are changed/re-rendered based on the user details.

### Calculations

First step is to gather data from the user. We need age, sex, height, weight and other physical details about the person, to determine final result.
